# Tempo
Tempo is a simple stopwatch app with a twist for the Apple Watch. Created for running, the purpose of the app is to help maintain pace for runners. Users set a beep interval when they open the app, and while using the stopwatch, the watch will vibrate / beep every time the interval of time has passed.
